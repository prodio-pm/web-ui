UNDER SIGNIFICANT REFACTOR!!!
=============================

The first itteration of Prodio was great, it proved the concept worked.  Now
its time to build something real and useable out of it.

So, I'm completely refactoring the code to be reusable.  I'm also switching out
the UI for a React.js based UI.

Basically, for now, use at your own risk or for research :)

Prodio
======

Prodio in Latin means to "Come forth, appear, proceed and/or project".  It
seemed like the prefect name for a project that hopes to help to move project
management from a taboo topic into an enjoyable experience.

Prodio is NOT ready yet.  Please keep an eye out though as it is making progress.

Web UI
======

Still need to add stuff to this.
